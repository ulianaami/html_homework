        In the afternoon, around 3pm, I get SUPER sleepy. I need a pick me up. And that pick me up during warmer weathered months is this: an Iced Matcha Latte.

And in the afternoon when I need a bit of a pick-me-up and know I can’t handle coffee or an espresso beverage (I’ll be up all night), a matcha latte is the perfect go-to.

      <h2>What is Matcha?</h2>
      <p class="lh-base">
        Matcha powder is made up of ground up green tea leaves. Instead of brewing a cup of tea with tea leaves, this is ground up leaves that are dissolved into the warm/hot water. If you ever have the privilege of visiting Kyoto, Japan, be sure to go to a tea house and buy some beautiful matcha green tea powder for the road. The packets make great gifts.
      </p>
      <h2>How to make iced matcha latte</h2>
      <h2>Step 1:</h2>
      <p class="lh-base">
        You put a few teaspoons of matcha powder in a measuring cup and add a few tablespoons of hot water.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 2:</h2>
      <p class="lh-base">
        <a href="#" class="link-success">Whisk</a> it until the matcha has dissolved and then you pour in the remaining water and whisk some more. I transfer it to the fridge or freezer to chill for about 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 3:</h2>
       <p class="lh-base">
          After the matcha is cooled, add a ridiculous amount of ice to a glass. And then, pour the almond milk (or milk of choice) into the glass and a splash of simple syrup. Lastly, pour in the matcha. As a result, there is unbridled happiness!

I mean…this isn’t really a recipe but more of an idea of inspiration? (I hope…?)
